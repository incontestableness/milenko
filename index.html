		<h1>The Great Milenko</h1>

		<h2>What is Milenko?</h2>
		<p>
			"Milenko's Bot Detector" is an <strong>"anti-bot bot"</strong> <i>(yes, really...)</i> that helps to remove malicious bots from Team Fortress 2 casual matches by detecting, reporting, votekicking, and killing them in the interim.<br>
			In other words, Milenko bots are "Friendly Botkillers".<br>
			Their name stems from the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAU54CvzCwg">"The Great Milenko" by Insane Clown Posse.</a><br>
		</p>

		<h2>What does Milenko do?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Milenko bots join casual matches in Team Fortress 2 and automatically detect malicious bots.</li>
			<li>Milenko bots will join as the Spy class and perform either the Disco Fever or Luxury Lounge taunt in the spawn room.</li>
			<br>
			<li>If a malicious bot is detected in the match, Milenko bots will:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Announce a list of the malicious bots on each team in the chat every 15 seconds or so.</li>
				<li>Try to call vote kicks on these bots as soon as possible.</li>
				<li>Switch to the Sniper class and target <strong>only</strong> these malicious bots.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>This helps to prevent malicious bots from ruining the fun of innocent players and makes it immediately obvious when malicious bots are present.</li>
			<br>
			<li>When a votekick is called, they will also inform players in chat <strong>whether or not the player being kicked is a known bot.</strong></li>
			<li>This helps to prevent innocent players from being kicked by malicious bots or other players.</li>
			<li>Milenko bots will automatically vote Yes on malicious bots and No on regular players.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Will Milenko bots leave once all the malicious bots are kicked from the match?</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Yes, they will.</strong> They stay in every new match for a brief period (about 15 seconds after setup time ends) to detect malicious bots, but they will leave automatically.<br>
			Since Milenko bots leave automatically, there is no need to kick them.<br>
			Trying to kick a Milenko bot only puts you on a 2 minute votekick cooldown and prevents you from kicking an actual malicious bot when one joins.
		</p>

		<h2>Do Milenko bots "take up" player slots?</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>No.</strong> Only one Milenko bot will be in a given match at a time, for merely 15 seconds, unless there is a malicious bot.<br>
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj00ii1BLV8">That still leaves 23 player slots for you</a> during those 15 seconds.<br>
			<br>
			Milenko's goal is to kick malicious bots back into the matchmaking queue as soon as possible.<br>
			The less time a malicious bot is in a match, the better.
		</p>

		<h2>How can I tell the difference between Milenko and malicious bots?</h2>
		<p>Please read <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1935994199">this guide</a> for basic information on how to identify common malicious bots.</p>
		<p>Here's a few more things that can help to distinguish Milenko bots from malicious bots:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Some malicious bots use Milenko's old profile picture (see <a href="favicon.ico">here</a>) in an attempt to impersonate them.</li>
			<li>Malicious bots may also try to impersonate Milenko bots by using names like "Milenko's Bot Detector" and the like.</li>
			<li><strong>REAL</strong> Milenko bots will use a <strong>random default TF2 avatar</strong> and a <strong>random name.</strong></li>
			<br>
			<li>Milenko bots will not wear any cosmetic items except for the Mann Co. hat.</li>
			<li>When a malicious bot is detected, Milenko bots will say "Sentry ahead!" every 15 seconds as a warning.</li>
			<li>After killing the last malicious bot on the other team, Milenko bots will taunt with "The Director's Vision".</li>
			<li>When no malicious bots are detected, Milenko bots will "explode" before leaving.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How can I help get rid of malicious bots?</h2>
		<p>
			You can download <a href="https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector">PazerOP's TF2 Bot Detector</a>, a program that helps to identify malicious bots and automatically kick them.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>We have our own list of malicious bots which you can add to the tool.</strong><br>
			This list is 100% accurate and only contains malicious bots. There is no way for a legitimate player to get added to the list.<br>
